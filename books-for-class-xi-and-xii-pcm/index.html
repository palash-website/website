    <p>My evergreen recommendations for science books in Class XI and XII are NCERT books which you can download from <a href="https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php">their site for free</a>, or buy from a nearby bookstore. Not everyone believes in this recommendation though - for some these books are too brief and cryptic.</p>

<p>Here are some of the books that I used when I was a student almost 30 years ago, and I find that they are still the favorites!</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentals_of_Physics">Fundamentals of Physics, by Resnick, Halliday</a></p>

<p>A remarkable book, and if you have to choose only one book to study from, this is the one. When I studied (1990-91), it was a thin book, now it weighs more than 5Kgs!</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/IrodovProblemsInGeneralPhysics">Problems in General Physics, by I E Irodov</a></p>

<p>A great collection of really tough physics questions. You can also find solutions book for this, which can be a good companion book. When I was studying, this book was a craze, and people who used to regularly quote from this book a question they had solved, were considered genius!</p>
