<p>CODE is an attempt to solve the problems that face India today. When opinionated people come together 
  and engage via dialoges to produce constructive, India develops. 
</p>
<p>  The goal of this site is to trigger such conversations and participate in it to produce India scale solutions.

        <p><strong>Welcome to my digital home!</strong></p>

<p>While this site includes content on a diverse set of topics, there is a common thread across all of them - C.O.D.E.</p>

<p><strong>C.O.D.E - Constructive and Opinionated Dialoges for Engagement</strong></p>

<p>C.O.D.E is what I believe we need in order to understand and solve the problems that face India today. We need opinionated people to come together and engage via dialoges to produce constructive ideas that we together feel can address any given problem at India scale. This is a hard act, but the outcomes will be amazing and hence this is an act worth pursuing.</p>

<p>I am passionate about many topics: Education &amp; Career, Technology &amp; Society, and Policy &amp; Governance. I strongly believe that a systems thinking and data-driven decision-making can help us get alignment in problems and quality in solutions.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s CODE!</p>
