<p>CODE is an attempt to solve the problems that face India today. When opinionated people come together 
  and engage via dialoges to produce constructive, India develops. 
</p>
<p>  The goal of this site is to trigger such conversations and participate in it to produce India scale solutions.

    <p>Finally I started my mandarin lessons, 3 days a week, 100 minutes each. First 2 classes were about sounds (called Finals in the book), and how to make simple words using the initials (consonants). I was amazed to know there are 39 finals (English has only 5 vowels and 2 semi-vowels in comparison, hindi has about 12 ‘<em>swara’</em>)! This is one more reason learning this will be tough. My teacher is good but her English is not good enough to understand what I am trying to communicate many times, but we are learning!</p>

<p>I also visited couple of huge bookstores, which obviously carry all the books in mandarin. I am much more enthused now about the language, hopefully I can learn to read it so that I can have the joy of walking in those big shops and picking some books to read (even the largest Barnes and Noble I found in US was comparable to these shops).</p>

<p>Here are some tools I found on the web which are useful:</p>

<p><a href="http://babelfish.yahoo.com/translate_txt">Yahoo Babelfish</a> – useful when someone writes something to you in Chinese but you can’t understand; or when you want to wow someone by writing in Chinese. Supports many language translations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mandarintools.com/worddict.html">English-Chinese Dictionary</a> – I like the English and pinyin search because it gives pronunciation of the word which is extremely helpful. Note how many different meanings exist for each word.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">Pinyin on Wikipedia</a> – As usual, this is a great reference for those who want to know all about something in one go, with rules and all.</p>
