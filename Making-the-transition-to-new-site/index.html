<p>CODE is an attempt to solve the problems that face India today. When opinionated people come together 
  and engage via dialoges to produce constructive, India develops.

    <p>For a very long time, I have hosted my sites using wordpress.com. They were cost-effective, and didn’t suck me into maintenance and tweaking tasks (that wordpress.org did).</p>

<p>However, more recently, the price has been going up, packages seem to be designed for those who are running business of some kind using these sites. Clearly, someone having a simple blog site who doesn’t want ads and wants a few nice themes and plug-ins to spruce it up doesn’t fit. Hence, while my bill kept going up (I have 2-3 sites that I use regularly), they mostly went in getting rid of the problems they created in the first place (pesky ads, limits on themes and plugins). 
So I felt it was time to look for cheaper alternatives an github presented itself as a worthy one, given my limited needs.</p>

<p>So here I am, with a much simplified web site, that only focuses on the content. I am also taking this opportunity to merge my three personas: the researcher, the career coach, and the opinionated Indian! This is always a tricky proposition, given the audiences are different for each of my persona, but we will see how that goes!</p>
