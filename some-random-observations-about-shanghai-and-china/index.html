<p>CODE is an attempt to solve the problems that face India today. When opinionated people come together 
  and engage via dialoges to produce constructive, India develops. 
</p>
<p>  The goal of this site is to trigger such conversations and participate in it to produce India scale solutions.

<p>It has been a long time since I posted here, sorry about that. I have been busy in the process of settling down which has afforded me some observations which I will share over coming days. These are some of the observations I have had since we have been in Shanghai but I was trying to collect more instances, reasons or facts before presenting them to you. Some of these are based on discussions with a few of my colleagues while others are my own observations over last 2 months. Please read this more as a tidbit to be enjoyed rather than authentic cultural information. There are very good sites out there which can provide you good information about culture, <a href="http://www.chinese-tools.com/">Chinese-tools.com</a> has been a recent find for me which I have liked. Some of the topics I want to cover are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Marriages and how they are different from India</li>
  <li>Traffic conditions</li>
  <li>Getting books in China</li>
  <li>Many chinese websites have numbers in them, is there any reason?</li>
  <li>Learning Chinese is hard if you only know English!</li>
  <li>About Chinese people</li>
</ol>

<p>Â </p>

<p>Let me know if you have questions that you would like me to address through these posts, or additional ones.</p>
